**Project Title**: Beer Data Analysis using SQL

**Project Description**:

This project focuses on analyzing a small relational database called "BeerDB" with the goal of extracting useful information about the world of beer. The database contains various entities related to breweries, beers, ingredients, and more. The project involves writing SQL queries and views to satisfy specific information requests and implementing PLpgSQL functions to support higher-level activities, potentially in a web interface.

**Project Objectives**:

1. **Data Exploration**: Gaining a deep understanding of the BeerDB schema, including relationships between entities and the types of information available.

2. **SQL Queries and Views**: Writing SQL queries and creating views to extract valuable insights from the database, ensuring a consistent and readable SQL code style.

3. **PLpgSQL Functions**: Developing PLpgSQL functions that can support higher-level activities, such as those needed for a web interface.

**Database Overview**:
- The database contains information about breweries, beers, ingredients, and more.
- Relationships between entities, such as breweries producing beers, are captured in the schema.
- The accuracy of brewery locations varies, from countries to specific towns or suburbs.

**Key Points Explored**:
1. Identifying breweries founded in the Sydney metropolitan area.

2. Finding beers with names matching their styles.

3. Determining the oldest breweries.

4. Listing IPA variations and count the number of beers in each style.

5. Identifying breweries, providing the most precise location (town/suburb or metropolitan area).

6. Finding the strongest barrel-aged beers and their breweries.

7. Identifying the most frequently used hop variety.

8. Finding breweries that do not produce common beer styles (IPAs, Lagers, Stouts).

9. Determining the most commonly used grain in Hazy IPA beers.

10. Identifying ingredients not used in any beers.

11. Creating a PLpgSQL function to get the ABV range of beers brewed in a specific country.

12. Creating a PLpgSQL function to search for beers by a partial name and return information about matching beers.

**Project Scope**:
- This project involves in-depth SQL querying, view creation, and PLpgSQL function development.
- The goal is to provide valuable insights into the world of beer through data analysis.

**Note**: Detailed SQL queries, views, and PLpgSQL functions are available in the project files for reference.
